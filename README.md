If the demo GIF does not load, run locally or open the repo in Gitpod (click the badge at the top) to see the app running instantly in a cloud workspace.

Quick start

1. flutter pub get
2. flutter run

Optional: Run instantly in the cloud

- Click the "Open in Gitpod" badge above (or visit: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Tanvir284/E-Commerce-app) to launch a ready-to-code environment. Gitpod will install Flutter and dependencies so you can run the app in a browser-based IDE.

Development
