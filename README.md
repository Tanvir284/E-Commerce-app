# Modern E-Commerce Flutter App â€” Phase 1

This branch adds Phase 1 recruiter-facing features:
- Wishlist with local persistence (shared_preferences)
- Persistent cart (saved locally)
- Product image carousel for richer product detail
- Wishlist screen and wishlist toggle from product cards

How to run
1. flutter pub get
2. flutter run

Notes
- Firebase config can be added later; local persistence works without Firebase.
- I will continue with Phase 2 (Firestore sync, social sign-ins) next.
```
